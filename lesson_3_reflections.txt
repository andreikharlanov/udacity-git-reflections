When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I work with other people. And when I'd like to have a backup of my repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I want to pull changes from remote repository to my local one only when I'm ready to do it, so the code doesn't break.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branch is a version of the code in the current repository.
I'll use branches if I need to develop a new feature or fix a bug.
Clone is a copy of the existing repository.
I'll use clones if I'd like to have my copy of someone's repository.
Fork is like a clone, but it's made on the GitHub servers without cloning of the repository to the local computer.
