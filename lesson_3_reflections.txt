When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I work with other people. And when I'd like to have a backup of my repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I want to pull changes from remote repository to my local one only when I'm ready to do it, so the code doesn't break.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branch is a version of the code in the current repository.
I'll use branches if I need to develop a new feature or fix a bug.
Clone is a copy of the existing repository.
I'll use clones if I'd like to have my copy of someone's repository.
Fork is like a clone, but it's made on the GitHub servers without cloning of the repository to the local computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
That way you can see the relations between local and remote repositories:
are they in sync, is remote repository is ahead of the local one or vice versa,
or are they are out of sync. Also, if you have a copy of the remote repository,
you can see if there are any conflicts in the code.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would use shared Dropbox folder.
It would be easier just because everything will sync automatically.
But it would be much harder to keep track of who changed what.
And it would be very difficult to work simultaneously on the same files.
