When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I work with other people. And when I'd like to have a backup of my repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I want to pull changes from remote repository to my local one only when I'm ready to do it, so the code doesn't break.
