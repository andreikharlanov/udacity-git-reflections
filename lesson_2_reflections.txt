What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git starts to monitor the directory for the changes in files.
I need to do it so I can make a commit when I'd like to.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a middle ground between the working directory and the repository.
It may contain only some parts of the changes in files currently stored in working directory.
And all of the changes that the staging area contain will be part of the repository after the commit.
